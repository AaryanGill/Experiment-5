# 🚀 Unit-5: Optimize Frontend Performance Using Lazy Loading

## 📌 Experiment-5.1: Lazy Loading a Dashboard Component Using React.lazy and Suspense

---

## 🧠 Aim

To optimize frontend performance by implementing lazy loading of a **Dashboard component** in a React application using **React.lazy** and **Suspense**, without using routing.

---

## 🛠️ Software Requirements

- Node.js
- React
- VS Code (or any code editor)
- Web Browser

---

## 📖 Theory

Lazy loading is a performance optimization technique in which components are loaded only when they are required instead of loading all components at once during the initial render.

In React:

- `React.lazy()` is used to dynamically import a component.
- `Suspense` is used to display a fallback UI (such as a loading message or spinner) while the component is being loaded.

This reduces the initial bundle size and improves application performance, especially in large applications.

---

## ⚙️ Procedure

1. Create a React application.
2. Create a `Dashboard` component.
3. Import the `Dashboard` component using `React.lazy()`.
4. Wrap the component inside `Suspense`.
5. Trigger the dashboard loading using a button click.
6. Observe the loading behavior.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

After completing this experiment, the following outcomes were achieved:

- Understood the concept of lazy loading in React.
- Learned how to use `React.lazy()` for dynamic component imports.
- Implemented `Suspense` with fallback UI for loading states.
- Improved frontend performance by reducing initial bundle size.
- Gained practical knowledge of code splitting in Single Page Applications.
