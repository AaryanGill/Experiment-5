# 🚀 Unit-5: Optimize Frontend Performance Using Lazy Loading

## 📌 Experiment-5.2: Route-Based Lazy Loading Using React.lazy and Suspense

---

## 🧠 Aim

To optimize frontend performance by implementing route-based lazy loading in a React application using **React.lazy**, **Suspense**, and **React Router DOM**.

---

## 🛠️ Software Requirements

- Node.js
- React
- React Router DOM
- VS Code (or any code editor)
- Web Browser

---

## 📖 Theory

Route-based lazy loading is a performance optimization technique where components are loaded only when a specific route is accessed.

In React:

- `React.lazy()` is used to dynamically import components.
- `Suspense` is used to show a fallback UI while components load.
- `React Router DOM` enables navigation between different routes in a Single Page Application (SPA).

This technique reduces the initial bundle size and improves page load speed by splitting code into smaller chunks that are loaded only when required.

---

## ⚙️ Procedure

1. Create a React application.
2. Install React Router DOM.
3. Create multiple components (Home, About, Dashboard).
4. Import components using `React.lazy()`.
5. Wrap routes inside `Suspense`.
6. Navigate between routes and observe loading behavior.
